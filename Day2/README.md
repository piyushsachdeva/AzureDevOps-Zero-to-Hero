# Day2 Azure Boards and Agile Project Management 📊 - Work in progress

## Azure DevOps Demo Generator


## Azure Boards Overview
Azure board is a project management tool to plan and track your work.

## Defining Teams and Work Items
### What is a Work Item:
A work item can track all types of activities. It could be a 
*  task to do
*  a bug to fix,
*  or some other issue.
  We can assign them to people and keep track of their progress.

## Azure Boards Processes

1) **Basic**: Choose Basic when your team wants the simplest model that uses Issues, Tasks, and Epics to track work.
2) **Agile**
3) **Scrum**
4) **CMMI**

The basic process contains three work item types:
- Epics: Group your more significant items into Epics such as Website updates, Cloud migration, CICD implementation
- Issues: Further divide your Epics into Issues such as Homepage, about us page, secure sign-in
- Task: Tasks are the smallest amount of work that can be assigned to someone, for example, designing a homepage header, standardizing fonts, and fixing the homepage css to make it mobile responsive.

## Defining Sprints

A sprint is the amount of time we have to complete our tasks. Sprints help keep us focused. At the end, we can have a short retrospective meeting to share what we've accomplished. After that, we can plan the next one.
 A sprint is typically two to four weeks long.
